Ack-menu is a fork of Nikolaj Schumacher's full-ack. Instead of offering a set of emacs variables that control what command line options are passed to ack, it uses mag-menu.el to provide an intuitive menu-based front-end to ack.

Ack-menu also has an improved ack output parsing mechanism, which fixes a few bugs that were present in full-ack.
